## Overview

Corsa is a library for creating buffered readable / writable channels in JavaScript. This library was specifically written to help solve backpressure issues that can occur when dealing with high frequency messaging using traditional event listeners in JavaScript.

Corsa approaches this problem by making the channels sender await and suspend at buffer capacity. This helps to ensure the senders send rate is locked to the throughput allowed by a receiver.

Requires async/await and AsyncIteration support. Tested natively on Node v10.

## channel&lt;T&gt;

A channel is a uni-directional pipe for which data can flow. The following code creates an `unbounded` channel which allows for near infinite buffering of messages between `writable` and `readable`. The call to channel returns a `channel` object, which we destructure into the readable and writable pairs.

```typescript
const { readable, writable } = channel()
```
The following creates a bounded channel which allows for sending `5` values before suspending (see bounded vs unbounded)

```typescript
const { readable, writable }  = channel(5)
```

## Writer&lt;T&gt;

The following code creates an unbounded channel and sends the values `1, 2, 3` followed by a call to `end()` to signal `EOF` to a receiver.

```typescript
const { readable, writable } = channel<number>()

writable.write(1)
writable.write(2)
writable.write(3)
writable.end()

```

## Reader&lt;T&gt;

The `Reader<T>` is the receiving side of a channel and supports `for-await-of` for general iteration. 

```typescript
const { readable, writable } = channel()
writable.write(1)
writable.write(2)
writable.write(3)
writable.end()

for await (const value of readable) {
  console.log(value)
}

```

## bounded vs unbounded

By default all channels are `unbounded` but it is possible to set a fixed buffering size when creating a `channel()`. When setting a channel size, this will cause a writable to pause at `await` when sending values. The `await` at the writable will only occur once the channels buffer has filled with values. The writable will remained suspended until such time a receiver starts pulling values from the channel.

The following code demostrates this behavior with channel bound to a buffer of 5.

```typescript
const { readable, writable } = channel(5)
await writable.write(1) 
await writable.write(2) 
await writable.write(3) 
await writable.write(4) 
await writable.write(5) // - at capacity, the readable will need to read something.

await writable.write(6) // suspend  <-----+
                        //                | - readable.read() dequeues one element from the
...                     //                |   stream which will cause the writable to resume.
                        //                |  
await readable.read()   // resume   ------+
```

## select

This library provides a simple channel `select` function similar to multi channel select found in the Go programming language. It allows multiple `Reader<T>` types to be combined into a singular stream.

```typescript
import { channel, select } from 'corsa'

function strings() {
  const { readable, writable } = channel<string>()
  setInterval(() => writable.write('hello world'), 100)
  return readable
}

function numbers() {
  const { readable, writable } = channel<number>()
  setInterval(() => writable.write(Math.random()), 200)
  return readable
}

async function start() {
  const readable = select(strings(), numbers())
  for await (const value of readable) {
    console.log(value)
  }
}
```
